    <h2>LEOPARDS IN SRI LANKA</h2>
    <p class="quickbox">
      Sri Lankan leopards, scientifically known as Panthera pardus kotiya,
      epitomize the mystique and resilience of the island's wildlife.<br />
      Endemic to Sri Lanka, these majestic big cats represent a unique
      subspecies distinguished by their smaller stature and vibrant, golden
      coats adorned with distinctive rosettes.<br />
      Thriving in diverse habitats, from dense rainforests to dry plains, these
      elusive predators navigate the island's varied landscapes with stealth and
      grace.<br />
      Despite their adaptability, Sri Lankan leopards face formidable challenges
      due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflicts, and illegal poaching.<br />
      Conservation efforts aim to safeguard these iconic creatures, emphasizing
      habitat preservation, community engagement, and anti-poaching measures.<br />
      Revered in local folklore and entrenched in Sri Lanka's ecological
      tapestry, the survival of the Sri Lankan leopard signifies not only the
      resilience of a species but also the commitment to preserving the island's
      natural heritage.<br />
      The Sri Lankan leopard's enigmatic presence within the island's ecosystems
      sparks both fascination and concern.<br />
      Their solitary and nocturnal nature makes them elusive, often traversing
      the realms of protected national parks and human-dominated landscapes
      alike.<br />
      Sadly, encroachment, habitat fragmentation, and human-wildlife conflicts
      pose grave threats to their existence.<br />
      Despite these challenges, dedicated conservation initiatives, research
      endeavors, and community involvement strive to secure their future.<br />
      Revered as a symbol of Sri Lanka's rich biodiversity, the preservation of
      these leopards not only safeguards a unique subspecies but also
      underscores the crucial balance between conservation efforts and
      sustainable coexistence with wildlife.<br />
      Sri Lankan leopards embody the essence of the island's wild spirit,
      serving as ambassadors for conservation in their diverse habitats.<br />
      Adaptable and elusive, Sri Lankan leopards navigate diverse landscapes,
      representing both the resilience and vulnerability of unique island
      wildlife.

    <p class="quickbox">
      <b>Habitat Loss Threat to Leopards:</b> Habitat loss imperils leopard
      populations, disrupting their territories and prey availability.<br />
      Fragmented landscapes limit their movement, gene pool, and access to
      resources, heightening conflicts with humans.<br />
      <b>Consequences of Habitat Loss:</b> Loss leads to reduced leopard
      numbers, increased human-wildlife conflicts, and ecological imbalance.<br />
      It diminishes the leopard's ability to thrive and perpetuates their
      vulnerability.<br />
      <b>Conservation Mechanisms to Mitigate Threats:</b> Focused efforts
      preserve critical leopard habitats through reserves, wildlife corridors,
      and restoration initiatives.<br />
      Community engagement fosters sustainable practices, curbing conflicts.<br />
      Monitoring aids in assessing leopard health and guides conservation
      strategies.<br />
      Collaborative approaches among authorities, conservationists, and
      communities are pivotal for securing and restoring vital leopard habitats.

    <p class="quickbox">
      <b>Threat of Declining Prey Base:</b> Declines in the population of
      leopard prey species, such as deer and other small mammals, directly
      impact the survival and sustenance of leopard populations.<br />
      Factors like habitat degradation and overhunting contribute to prey base
      reduction.<br />
      <b>Consequences of Declining Prey Base:</b> A scarcity of prey affects
      leopard survival, reproduction, and overall population health.<br />
      It forces leopards to seek alternative food sources, sometimes leading to
      conflicts with humans or unsustainable hunting practices.<br />
      <b>Conservation Mechanisms to Mitigate Threats:</b> Preserving and
      restoring habitats for prey species, implementing sustainable hunting
      practices, and managing ecosystems to support diverse prey populations are
      critical.<br />
      Monitoring prey populations and regulating hunting activities help
      maintain a healthy balance, ensuring adequate food sources for leopard
      survival.<br />
      Community engagement in sustainable resource use and habitat conservation
      also aid in preserving the prey base for leopard populations.
