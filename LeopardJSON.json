    "THREAT TO THE LEOPARD - HABITAT LOSS": "Habitat Loss Threat to Leopards: Habitat loss imperils leopard populations, disrupting their territories and prey availability. Fragmented landscapes limit their movement, gene pool, and access to resources, heightening conflicts with humans. Consequences of Habitat Loss: Loss leads to reduced leopard numbers, increased human-wildlife conflicts, and ecological imbalance. It diminishes the leopard's ability to thrive and perpetuates their vulnerability. Conservation Mechanisms to Mitigate Threats: Focused efforts preserve critical leopard habitats through reserves, wildlife corridors, and restoration initiatives. Community engagement fosters sustainable practices, curbing conflicts. Monitoring aids in assessing leopard health and guides conservation strategies. Collaborative approaches among authorities, conservationists, and communities are pivotal for securing and restoring vital leopard habitats.",
    "THREAT TO THE LEOPARD - LOSS OF PREY": "Threat of Declining Prey Base: Declines in the population of leopard prey species, such as deer and other small mammals, directly impact the survival and sustenance of leopard populations. Factors like habitat degradation and overhunting contribute to prey base reduction. Consequences of Declining Prey Base: A scarcity of prey affects leopard survival, reproduction, and overall population health. It forces leopards to seek alternative food sources, sometimes leading to conflicts with humans or unsustainable hunting practices. Conservation Mechanisms to Mitigate Threats: Preserving and restoring habitats for prey species, implementing sustainable hunting practices, and managing ecosystems to support diverse prey populations are critical. Monitoring prey populations and regulating hunting activities help maintain a healthy balance, ensuring adequate food sources for leopard survival. Community engagement in sustainable resource use and habitat conservation also aid in preserving the prey base for leopard populations."
